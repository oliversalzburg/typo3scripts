> [!CAUTION]
> While these scripts were a lot of help, and a lot of fun to work on, while I was using TYPO3 10 years ago, I would no longer accept any changes to this repository. Thus, it has been **archived as of 2024-07-29**. I _hope_ that none of these scripts are necessary anymore in today's development of TYPO3 instances. In case they are, then the state they have been in over the past 10 years is probably good until the end of time :smile:

---

This is a collection of shell scripts that aid in TYPO3 deployment and maintenance.

The scripts in this project and their primary intended purpose are outlined as such:

- [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts/wiki/BootstrapSh)  
  Starting a new TYPO3 installation (no relation to Twitter Bootstrap).
- [createBackup.sh](https://github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts/wiki/CreateBackupSh)  
  Creates a snapshot of a TYPO3 installation.
- [restoreBackup.sh](https://github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts/wiki/RestoreBackupSh)  
  Restores aforementioned snapshots.
- [switchVersion.sh](https://github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts/wiki/SwitchVersionSh)  
  Switches between multiple versions of the TYPO3 core package.
- [fixPermissions.sh](https://github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts/wiki/FixPermissionsSh)  
  Fixes access permissions on the files of a TYPO3 installation.
- [extChangelog.sh](https://github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts/wiki/ExtChangelogSh)  
  Retrieve the upload comment history for an extension.
- [extUpdate.sh](https://github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts/wiki/ExtUpdateSh)  
  Retrieve update information for an extension (or all extensions) directly from the shell.
- [extExtract.php](https://github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts/wiki/ExtExtractPhp)  
  Extract and save or display the contents of a `.t3x` file.



## Downloads

After moving to GitHub, we no longer provide any pre-packaged downloads. If you want to retrieve the scripts without the use of git, please use the the [download as ZIP](archive/master.zip) feature. 

The recommended way of obtaining a needed script is directly from the source repository like so:

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts/master/bootstrap.sh

You can obtain the latest development version of a script the same way:

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts/dev/bootstrap.sh

Optionally, you can clone the whole project:

    $ git clone git://github.com/oliversalzburg/typo3scripts.git /var/www/my-typo3-site/

## Usage Examples
These usage examples should give a quick overview of the main, intended purpose of the provided scripts. For additional applications of these scripts, please see their dedicated wiki pages (as available).

### Cloning a TYPO3 installation using createBackup.sh and restoreBackup.sh
In the latest development builds, you're able to restore a backup made on a different installation, thus, replicating the original installation.

    /var/www/t3site$ sudo ./createBackup.sh
    Checking dependencies...Succeeded.
    Creating TYPO3 backup 'typo3-2012-11-28-16-32.tgz'...
    Creating database dump at 'typo3/database.sql'...Done.
    Compressing TYPO3 installation...Done.
    /var/www/t3site$ cp typo3-2012-11-28-16-32.tgz ../t3site-test/
    /var/www/t3site$ cd ../t3site-test/
    /var/www/t3site-test$ sudo ./restoreBackup.sh typo3-2012-11-28-16-32.tgz
    Checking dependencies...Succeeded.
    Testing write permissions in typo3...Succeeded
    Erasing current TYPO3 installation 'typo3'...Done.

You may have to utilize [fixPermissions.sh](wiki/FixPermissionsSh) afterwards to adjust permissions for your webserver user. You'll also have to adjust your database settings and domain records in the cloned TYPO3 instance afterwards.
